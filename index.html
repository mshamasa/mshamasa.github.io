                Hey welcome to my cheap ass free blog. Could I have used a free
                service? Yeah, so. Anyway these are my random thoughts I would
                like to share as a software engineer, I hope it helps you.:w

        <h2>Fast.ai Machine Learning for Coders</h2>
        <article>
            <h2>10/27/20: Fast.ai Lesson 1</h2>
            <p>
                First impressions, fantastic! Even if you don’t plan on writing
                code, going through this material and learning about Machine
                Learning (ML); is worth it. It gives you an insight into how the
                magic happens, which boils down to simple mathematics, depending
                on the model you use. Imagine (1 + 1) just being done 1 million
                times, somewhere along those lines. But the best part is
                learning how they are trained. In lesson 1 you will learn how a
                model is trained like an Image classifier, you build a cat one
                yourself! You also learn about the many layers in a model and
                how each layer builds on top of each other. Finally I think the
                most important takeaway was how to use validation sets and test
                sets. The insight into testing will not only help you as an
                individual learning but as an organization as well.

                Downside right now? Documentation, but just ever so slightly.
                Links lead to different pages and content, but I understand this
                is constantly being updated, so I can’t really hold it against
                them. Especially if they are giving this away for free.

        <h2>Neovim</h2>
        <article>
            <h2>08/01/20: Why I'm using Neovim</h2>
            <p>
                Well it started out like any “why” starts out. Either to impress
                someone (married...so nope), boredom (yup this one). It took a
                little while to get used to the keys and commands, but honestly
                you don’t need to know that many. If anything I would recommend
                making the switch just to show how little you need in terms of
                what an IDE comes with. What are the essentials? Copy and Paste
                Search and Replace Code Formatting (I’ll never quit you
                Prettier!) Git merge conflicts (I still use VSCode for issue)
                After reading and watching so many videos on how to customize
                Neovim to get all the cool features I had on VSCode I learned
                why VIM came about. The logic of you should only be editing
                files, was an interesting idea. After having written so many
                lines of code, I noticed that I tend to edit files more often
                now then before. Down side? I end a lot of my emails now with
                jjjjkkk trying to move up or down.:w
