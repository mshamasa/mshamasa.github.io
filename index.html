            Hey welcome to my cheap ass free blog. Could I have used a free
            service? Yeah, so. Anyway these are my random thoughts I would like
            to share as a software engineer, I hope it helps you.:w

        <h2>Fast.ai Machine Learning for Coders</h2>
        <article>
          <h2>10/27/20: Fast.ai Lesson 1</h2>
          <p>
            First impressions, fantastic! Even if you don’t plan on writing
            code, going through this material and learning about Machine
            Learning (ML); is worth it. It gives you an insight into how the
            magic happens, which boils down to simple mathematics, depending on
            the model you use. Imagine (1 + 1) just being done 1 million times,
            somewhere along those lines. But the best part is learning how they
            are trained. In lesson 1 you will learn how a model is trained like
            an Image classifier, you build a cat one yourself! You also learn
            about the many layers in a model and how each layer builds on top of
            each other. Finally I think the most important takeaway was how to
            use validation sets and test sets. The insight into testing will not
            only help you as an individual learning but as an organization as
            well.

            Downside right now? Documentation, but just ever so slightly. Links
            lead to different pages and content, but I understand this is
            constantly being updated, so I can’t really hold it against them.
            Especially if they are giving this away for free.

        <h2>Neovim</h2>
        <article>
          <h2>08/01/20: Why I'm using Neovim</h2>
          <p>
            Well it started out like any “why” starts out. Either to impress
            someone (married...so nope), boredom (yup this one). It took a
            little while to get used to the keys and commands, but honestly you
            don’t need to know that many. If anything I would recommend making
            the switch just to show how little you need in terms of what an IDE
            comes with. What are the essentials? Copy and Paste Search and
            Replace Code Formatting (I’ll never quit you Prettier!) Git merge
            conflicts (I still use VSCode for issue) After reading and watching
            so many videos on how to customize Neovim to get all the cool
            features I had on VSCode I learned why VIM came about. The logic of
            you should only be editing files, was an interesting idea. After
            having written so many lines of code, I noticed that I tend to edit
            files more often now then before. Down side? I end a lot of my
            emails now with jjjjkkk trying to move up or down.:w
